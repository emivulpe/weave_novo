				This page is designed so you can print it, and then fill in student names.  You can then cut off the right hand strip of student IDs, and pass them to the relevant students.  Then you and the student have a record of their unique student ID. </p>

			<p> Some teachers have suggested that you would hand them out and take them in again on each lesson where you were using the system.  Alternatively, the pupils just keep their ID safely, for use in the classroom or at home.  You always have the original on paper. </p>

			<p> We do not keep your name or your pupilsâ€™ names on-line, so keep the mapping from name to student ID secure.  You can select the columns of student ID here and paste them into a spreadsheet, and keep a more secure copy of name to ID there, if you wish. </p>
